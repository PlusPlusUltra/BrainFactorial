# BrainFactorial
A simple Brainf*ck program to compute the factorial of a given number.

## Things to notice
As of now it only works with one digit numbers as inputs, but it's really easy to extend it so that it works with bigger numbers as well.
This was done mainly as a challenge cast by my professor to those who didn't put back the chairs they took from other rooms in our lab after the lessons.
I put my chair back but did it anyway. He was kidding about it obviously and was surprised that I actually did it. Since it was done as a challenge and I
had never used Brainf*ck none of the code was taken from other sources except for the lines that transform a multiple digit number into ASCII.

To use it just run it, input the number you want to know the factorial of and push enter.
Since in BF it's quite annoying to write comments which include symbols that are part of the language, I decided to make 2 versions, one with only the code and the other one with comments.
The one with the comments is not runnable. Actually, you can run it if you like infinite loops.  
I wrote the comments mostly as personal notes, so if they are obscure and not understandable feel free to open an issue to let me know.
